    <h3>1. What is Wildlife Crime</h3>

    <p>The definition of wildlife crime can be broken down into two parts. Firstly, the definition of wildlife means
        all fauna and flora. ‘Fauna’ are animals and birds but also include fish. ‘Flora’ are plants such as orchids or
        cacti, but also include timber and timber forest products. The definition of crime refers to any acts committed
        contrary to national laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>It is important that we understand these definitions when we investigate these types of crimes. You should be
        aware of the definition of wildlife crime and the species that are afforded protection in your country.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of this handbook wildlife<strong> </strong>means <em>live wildlife and/or wildlife products
            including animals and plants but does not include fish</em>.</p>
