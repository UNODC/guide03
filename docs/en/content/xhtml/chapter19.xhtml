<h2><strong>19. Disposal of Wildlife</strong></h2>

<p>Some wildlife and wildlife products require specialist caring while others are perishable and may go off before the commencement of any court proceeding.</p>

<p>Some law enforcement agencies are permitted to dispose of wildlife and wildlife products prior to a court hearing in accordance with their national legislation or as per departmental policy. Check whether your department has rules and procedures around the disposal of wildlife.</p>

<p>Should you be authorised to dispose of the wildlife or wildlife products prior to a court case ensure that you have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Obtained permission to do so (if required)</li>
	<li>Taken or had taken any specimens that you will need for court</li>
	<li>Photographed the specimens</li>
	<li>Recorded on the chain of custody form how you have disposed of the wildlife</li>
	<li>Ensure that the disposal has been done in accordance with your departments policies</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to dispose of wildlife products correctly could potentially affect your case and bring adverse attention to you and your department.</p>

<p>You must always document the disposal of wildlife products.</p>
