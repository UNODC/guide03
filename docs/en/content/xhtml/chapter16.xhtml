    <h3>16. Forensic Considerations</h3>

    <p>Many items of evidence can be subject to forensic examination. Consider the following techniques.</p>

    <h6>Fingerprints</h6>

    <p>Can be found on many objects, including smooth surfaces (including ivory) and paper. If authorised, take the
        suspect’s fingerprints when you arrest them, even if they have been taken before.</p>


    <h6>Ballistics</h6>

    <p>Compare seized ammunition with seized firearms to determine which were used in crime. These items may match
        other unsolved crimes.</p>

    <h6>DNA</h6>

    <p>Can be taken from most animal or plant products, particularly fluids such as blood.</p>


    <h6>Chemical Analysis</h6>

    <p>Examine products such as paint, poisons or other chemicals to look for common characteristics linking crime
        scenes.</p>


    <h6>Mechanical Fit</h6>

    <p>Pieces of evidence may fit together in a unique way. These might include offcuts of timber, ivory, skin, or
        paper.</p>


    <h6>Tool Comparison</h6>

    <p>Carving tools, saws, knives may match with marks found on evidence such as ivory or timber.</p>


    <h6>Document Examination</h6>

    <p>Forensic examination of travel documents, identification cards or birth certificates may reveal that they are
        counterfeits or have been fraudulently altered</p>


    <h6>Handwriting Analysis</h6>

    <p>Compare the suspect’s handwriting to that found on documents, cheques, notebooks, diaries etc.</p>


    <h6>Digital Evidence</h6>

    <p>Mobile telephones, Computers, Laptops, SIM cards, portable storage devices and cards may hold valuable evidence
        of contacts, communications or financial information.</p>
