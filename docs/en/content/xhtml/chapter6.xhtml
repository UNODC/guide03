    <h3>6. The Internet and Wildlife Crime</h3>

    <p>The internet has revolutionised the way we live. As technology has developed so too has the way that criminals
        use this technology to facilitate their illegal activities. The advent of web-based encrypted communication
        applications, email, internet banking and the increased sophistication of mobile telephones have provided
        criminals with greater flexibility, security and reach.</p>

    <p>Wildlife crime facilitated via the internet is a major issue for law enforcement and conservation agencies. The
        main platforms used by criminals to facilitate wildlife crime include:</p>
    <center>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facebook</li>
                        <li>Line</li>
                        <li>WeChat</li>
                        <li>WhatsApp</li>
                        <li>Messenger</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Snapchat</li>
                        <li>Telegram</li>
                        <li>Instagram</li>
                        <li>Alibaba</li>
                        <li>Zalo</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>
    <p><img class="fullWidth" src="../imgs/G05_06.svg" /></p>

    <p>While these platforms make it easier for criminals to commit crime, they also present opportunities for
        investigators. You can use them as possible entry points for undercover investigators and for collecting
        intelligence and potentially evidence. Never use your own account to communicate with suspects on any of these
        sites. You should create or utilise covert accounts for your communications.</p>

    <p>Should you communicate with suspects on these sites with a view to collecting evidence remember to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that your actions are legal within your jurisdiction</li>
        <li>Ensure that you have sought the permission from your supervisor</li>
        <li>Always use a covert account</li>
        <li>Screenshot the suspects profile – this can be changed by them at a later date</li>
        <li>Screenshot any messages between you and the suspects</li>
        <li>Record any videos or messages they send to you</li>
        <li>Always ask for proof of possession – ask for a video with your covert name and the date</li>
        <li>Do not share your photograph with a suspect</li>
        <li>Refrain from talking via video with the suspect</li>
        <li>It is imperative that you know the market cost of the wildlife</li>
    </ul>
